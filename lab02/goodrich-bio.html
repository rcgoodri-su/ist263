        <h1>Ryan Goodrich's Biography</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Ryan Goodrich, a current third-year student studying Information Management & Technology with an aspiring concentration in <strong>data analytics</strong>. Technology has always been of interest to me with my involvement in extracurriculars such as robotics in middle school and high school. It was something that drove me to curiosity and, in turn, drove me to a further sense of learning. My transition to learning my first coding language in high school, Java, ultimately fueled my drive to further explore this technological field within my collegiate career.
